In this project, my partner and I studied Chinese and German lullabies to analyze their musicological features that may have cross-culturally soothing effects on a phrase level. Our project was conducted as a formal study - we developed research questions, wrote operational definitions, established hypothesese, and ran statistical analysis.

In the first half of the project, we collected and transcribed lullabies for our corpus of symbolic data. We stored the lullabies as .krn files using HumDrum notation. We collected 89 phrases from 12 notated German lullabies and a total of 82 phrases from 12 notated Chinese lullabies for our corpus.
We then developed anlaysis tools to access lullaby similarity as defined by different musicological features. We looked at note density, contour, phrase length, step-to-leap ratios, and long-to-short note duration ratios. We used Python, specifically the NumPy and Music21 libraries, to develop our tools and conduct our analysis.
After running the data anlaysis, we ran T-tests and Chi-Square tests to test our hypothesis. We found consistency with our hyphothesis, but this may be due to our small sample size and confined population.
